I just launched my podcast, The Tramcrazy Show. It's a regular roundup of all things technology, featuring makes, projects, tech news and much more! The distribution hasn't finished happening yet, butn it'll be available soon wherever you get your podcasts. For now, you can listen on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/tramcrazy) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/42xwacQM9b0SA0iv2ZcZJ3). I hope you enjoy the show - I'll post here whenever I publish new episodes.
