# My Dev Setup
I've been using Windows 11 on my PC since its general release on Tuesday, and I'm really enjoying it so far.
Here are some of my thoughts:
I definitely prefer it to Windows 10 - the UI is great.
There aren't really any new dev features.
I am really enjoying the dark theme.
## How I code
I use VS Code (the Windows version) on my PC, and I do most of my development through Windows Subsystem for Linux (I run Ubuntu). WSL works really well for my needs and the integration with Windows is amazing. Not to mention the integration with VS Code... I'm really enjoying my new development workflow and I'm loving Windows 11! Ask me any questions in the comments below.
