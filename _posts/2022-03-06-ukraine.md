In response to the ongoing situation in Ukraine, I've created a badge which you can embed in your GitHub READMEs or any website or markdown page. The badge is simple, and states that you support the independence of Ukraine. It links to the British Red Cross's Ukraine appeal. The badge looks like this:

<a href="https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/ukraine-crisis-appeal" alt="I support Ukraine's independence"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/I%20support-Ukraine's%20independence-yellow?labelColor=005bbb&color=ffd500&style=flat"></a>

You can find more information, and embed it in your own site, at [https://ukraine.tramcrazy.com](https://ukraine.tramcrazy.com).

Stay safe.
