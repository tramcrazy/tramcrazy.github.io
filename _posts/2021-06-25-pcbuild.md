# PC Build: Incoming!
I'm excited to be building my friend's PC with him very soon. I'll probably be posting one or more blogs on here about the process, to show you how to build one, and to dispel any fears you might have about the process. The build's key parts are a Ryzen 5 3600 and a GTX 1650. Also, I will probably post some kind of video on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNuvoZRyC_wwBqYBrh4K1Xw); this will probably be a compilation of a few clips of the most exciting stages! Stay tuned for more, coming soon, and let me know what kind of content you want to see on this blog - I'm considering a Python tutorial...
