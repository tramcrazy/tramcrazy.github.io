I've created lots of projects! You can find a few of them in my GitHub, but lots I've never published (fixing that soon!). I built an LED weather display, I'm working on a Discord bot, and I've completed too many TryHackMe rooms to count... I also work as a maintainer and contributor for [LiveG](https://github.com/LiveGTech)'s open-source projects.
