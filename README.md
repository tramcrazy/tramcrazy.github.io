# My blog

Welcome to the repo housing my blog, based on Agus Makmun's theme.

The blog is live using GitHub Pages and Jekyll at [tramcrazy.com](https://tramcrazy.com).

The issues on this repo are automated and controlled by [Utterances](https://utteranc.es) and therefore you shouldn't reply to them directly - use the commenting widgets on my blog instead. Find out more about how the commenting system works, and why I ended up using it, at [this post on my blog](https://tramcrazy.com/tech/others/2021/07/22/commenting.html).
